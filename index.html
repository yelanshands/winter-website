        <h2>Synopsis and Analysis of Arlecchino</h2>
        <h3>(by me!)</h3>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>As one of the most anticipated characters released in the video game Genshin Impact, Arlecchino’s appeal is evident given her design, her nuanced character, and her potential connection as the Fourth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers to major plot points. Her popularity was sparked by her first appearance in a teaser, followed by early accounts of her personality that painted her as a likely traitor and “a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” suggesting there is more to her than meets the eye.</p>
        <h3>Occupation</h3>
        <p>The Fatui Harbingers are the heads of the Fatui, an influential organization dedicated to serving the god of their nation, the Tsaritsa. Portrayed as the story’s antagonists, their goal is to obtain items called gnoses from other gods, though their methods suggest that they will go to extreme lengths to do so. Many of the Fatui’s troops, including spies and assassins, are raised in the House of the Hearth, an orphanage directed by Arlecchino. Leading the intelligence division of the Fatui, she is well aware of her reputation as “cold and cruel” and “a ruthless diplomat” in not only the eyes of outsiders but also her fellow harbingers. Even so, she does not intend to interfere with these rumors she deems false, stating that these only serve to give her an advantage working in intelligence. Arlecchino’s perspective on her image gives way to the more subtle aspects of herself, which include her past and how it is reflected in her interactions with others.</p>
        <h3>Childhood</h3>
        <p>Arlecchino, raised as Peruere, was an orphan forced to traverse worlds in a ritual, resulting in her growing up in the House of the Hearth. The biological mother of her best friend, Clervie, happens to be the head of the orphanage, a Fatui Harbinger, and the current Knave. Referred to as "Mother" by the children, she puts on a caring front all the while subjecting them to torture as she trains them to be soldiers for the Fatui. They are pitted against each other, forced onto dangerous missions, and issued harsh punishments for failure, all of which are fatal.</p>
        <p>Of the orphanage, Peruere and Clervie are the few who can see the corrupt reality behind Mother’s “kindness” in providing a home for orphans. Their failed attempts to escape only yielded abuse towards Clervie, Mother’s intention being to set an example for other children and demonstrate her impartial treatment towards even her biological daughter. Eventually, in a duel, Clervie asks for freedom through death, allowing Peruere to kill her. One year later, when Peruere is about 17 years old, she confronts Mother. Mother has always been impressed by Peruere’s supernatural powers caused by a curse and stresses that she merely wants to help Peruere in becoming the next “king” of the House. Following a close swordfight, Peruere brutally kills Mother with the aid of her curse, replacing Mother’s position in the Fatui as The Knave and Arlecchino.</p>
        <p>This reappointment did not come without changes. Her duty as a harbinger and Director of the House of the Hearth still requires her to train the orphans, the missions of the same degree of danger as before, though she is more lenient in her discipline of the children. Her role does not prevent or dissipate the bonds formed with her children, as she nonetheless engages in events such as birthdays, barbecue dinners, and cake-cutting with them.</p>
        <h3>Story Relevance</h3>
        <p>Being a diplomat, Arlecchino travels to other nations often, but her appearance in Fontaine, where she was raised, is due to the circumstances of its looming crisis. Utilizing her power as a harbinger, she garners information to form theories and presses further interrogations of Fontaine’s so-called god. She forms alliances to save more people from a smaller disaster, and the children of her orphanage join her to help orchestrate the god’s plans as they fall into place and resolve the major catastrophe.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Arlecchino’s work as a Fatui Harbinger demands a certain skillset involving the gathering of intelligence. Arlecchino successfully meets these expectations, her most notable skills including her prowess in combat, her knowledge, and her ability to read situations and turn them to her advantage. She has shown remarkable dexterity with the sword during her fight with Mother, dueling the former Harbinger on a similar level, as a teenager. In adulthood, her preferred weapon is a scythe, which she has mastered even the dual wielding of. In addition to weapons, her curse’s pyrokinesis gives her an edge in combat. This, coupled with Arlecchino’s intelligence, is how she excels at her job. She has a thirst for knowledge that extends from the psychological aspect of choosing deserts on behalf of others to the design principles of vehicles, allowing her to hold conversations on a variety of topics, which is especially useful for building connections. Arlecchino frequently brings up the idea of “wearing many masks” in reference to her public persona, revealing her expertise in manipulation tactics during her brief role as the interrogator of Fontaine’s god. Able to create a sense of pressure and control the discussion, she wrung out crucial information from the god, indirectly saving her nation and acquiring a gnosis.</p>
        <h3>Relationships</h3>
        <p>First mentioned in the main story as “Father,” this form of address intends to highlight the distinction between herself and Mother. Mother was described as a kind adult of the House, which was at the time seen as a fairytale of a thriving family. The opposite ended up true, demonstrating the contrast to Arlecchino introducing herself to her children as a strict and unfeeling “Father,” the difference being that through subtle acts of care, Arlecchino reveals a more gentle side.</p>
        <p>Her children acknowledge her stern nature and beliefs while holding great respect for her. When asked about Arlecchino, Lynette, an orphan, says, “Oh, how ‘Father’ expresses love... well, not everyone can accept it. But it is only because of ‘Father’ that home... can be called home.” Another orphan, Freminet, mentions her idea of crying being a display of emotion that is undesired and detrimental to the crucial operations of the House. She discourages her children from expressing these feelings, stating, “There are two things that must be avoided at all costs — anger and sorrow. Anger makes you impulsive. Sorrow causes you to waver.” However, in her character teaser, Arlecchino is seen standing in the rain at her child’s grave, and although no tears are seen, the raindrops flowing down her face symbolize the tears she suppresses in order to maintain her cold demeanor.</p>
        <p>These sentiments evidently stem from her childhood. Mother feigned kindness, eventually telling Peruere that as beautiful a quality as it is, it is also useless. Growing up in such conditions where Mother was the only parental figure is likely what caused her to view tears as a product of weakness. From her decision to go by “Father” rather than “Mother,” it is already known that Arlecchino does not wish to become like Mother, and in attempt to avoid that gentle facade she observed from Mother, she instead presents herself with a tough exterior, pushing her ideal of self-sufficiency onto her children and urging them to be their strongest, independent selves, especially in the case that they are faced with someone like Mother.</p>
        <p>Arlecchino’s effort to stray further away from Mother’s mentality can be seen as trying to break the cycle of abuse. Despite her best efforts to do so, however, she has developed an avoidant attachment style. This typically applies to individuals who appear to be confident but are emotionally unavailable, leading them to condemn children for showing emotion and vulnerability. Furthermore, she has said the following about raising spiders as a child: “Any affection bestowed upon them will not be returned, and they require little investment in terms of care. It's the kind of relationship that suits me perfectly.” From here, an inference can be made that she prefers a low-maintenance relationship in which there is no requirement or desire for an emotional connection, and it explains why she may seem detached from her children at times.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>An extremely accomplished, intelligent, and independent woman, Arlecchino is perfect on a mere surface-level view of her character. She exudes self-confidence as a Fatui Harbinger, and as “Father,” she encourages her children to fight against fate, alluding to the fact that they are orphans. She sees the best in them, yet behind this are her flaws in the manner she raises them. Her attempts of suppression when it comes to her children’s feelings unknowingly cause her to become the very person who hurt her — Mother. That being said, she was only shaped to fit the demands of the cruel environment she grew up in.</p>
        <h4>“Clervie once asked me what a ‘real home’ looks like, but I had no answer for her. How could any of us know the answer when the House of the Hearth is made up entirely of people who never had a place to call home?”</h4>
